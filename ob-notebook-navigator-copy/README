# ob-notebook-navigator-copy

A simple CustomJS script that adds a **“Copy Full Content”** option to the right-click menu in the [Notebook Navigator](https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator) plugin for Obsidian.

When clicked — or when double right-clicking on a note — the full Markdown content of that note is copied to your clipboard.

This is useful for workflows involving AI tools, quick note export, or copying content without opening the file.

## ✅ How to use

1. Install the [CustomJS plugin](https://github.com/saml-dev/obsidian-custom-js)
2. Place this file in your vault's `scripts/` directory
3. Set `scripts` as the **CustomJS folder** in the plugin settings
4. Click **“Add startup script”**
5. Select `NotebookNavigatorCopyExtension` from the list
6. Restart Obsidian

That’s it — no further setup needed. The script will automatically add the menu item when Notebook Navigator is loaded.
